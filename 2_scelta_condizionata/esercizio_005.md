# Exercise 5

The task is to write a program that interacts with the user in the following way:

1. The program asks the user for their age.
2. Based on the input, the program categorizes the user into one of the following age groups and prints out the result:
    - Child (age 0-12)
    - Teenager (age 13-19)
    - Adult (age 20-64)
    - Senior (age 65+)

## Inputs:

1. `age` (integer): The age of the user. This is a positive integer that the user will input when prompted by the program.

## Output:

- The program prints out the age group of the user based on the input age.

## Example:

### Input:
