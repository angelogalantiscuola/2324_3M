## Books with Dictionary

### Task 1: Create a Dictionary

Start by creating a dictionary. This dictionary should represent a book. Use keys such as `title`, `author`, and `year_published`, and assign appropriate values to them.

### Task 2: Add an Item

Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary. The key should be `genre` and the value should be any genre of your choice.

### Task 3: Change an Item

Change the value of one of the existing keys in the dictionary. For instance, you could change the value of the `year_published` key to a different year.

### Task 4: Delete an Item

Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary. You could remove the `author` key, for example.

### Task 5: Loop Through the Dictionary

Write three separate loops:

- One to print all the keys
- One to print all the values
- One to print all the key-value pairs (items) in the dictionary

Remember, Python's dictionary methods `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` will be useful in this task.
